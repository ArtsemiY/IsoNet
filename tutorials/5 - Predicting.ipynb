    "#### mrc_file, output_file\n",
    "The input mrc_file can be the exact tomograms used for training or other tomograms with the similar content and imaging condition. Predicted tomograms will be saved as output_file\n",
    " \n",
    "#### model\n",
    "The model file can be model trained on the corresponding training dataset from input tomograms or other pretrained model. Because the neural networks learn to restore information based on the features in training data, similar tomograms can share common trained networks.\n",
    "Model file should be in .h5 format\n",

    "## Advanced Parameters\n",
    "#### --batchsize\n",
    "The batch size of the cubes grouped into for network predicting. Greater batchsize will save more predicting time. It should be tuned compatible with your GPU memory\n",
    " \n",
    "#### --gpuID\n",
    "ID of gpus will be used for predicting i.e. 0,1,2,3 Users can find the information of their available GPUs through command: nvidia-smi\n",
    " \n",
    "#### --cube_size, --crop_size\n",
    "To fit the tomogram into the GPU memory, the entire tomogram is divided into multiple tiles for the missing wedge correction and using the overlap tile strategy to prevent the artifact during the montaging the tiles. To implement this strategy, the *crop_size* should be larger than the *cube_size*. The *cube_size* and *crop_size* is suggested to be consistent with the training settings.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### --norm\n",
    "If norm is set True, tomograms will be normalized by percentile, which scale the sub-tomograms in a range approximately from 0 to 1. If this is set False, the sub-tomograms will be normalized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1."
