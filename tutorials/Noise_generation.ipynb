    "## Noise Generation\n",
    "To help accelerate the missing wedge information retrieval, some artificial noise, which mimics the noise pattern in original tomograph, can be added to the sub-tomograms. Noise cubes are 3d arrays and also exhibit missing wedge effect along y axis\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase signal-to-noise ratio of the missing wedge corrected tomogram, MWR can perform missing wedge correction and denoising simultaneity using an algorithm similar to the denoising autoencoder (Citation). To do so, the input sub-tomograms of the neural net were added to the gaussian noise modulated by missing wedge, while the output sub-tomograms stay the same. During the training, the network will learn to remove the added noise in the input sub-tomograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you generated the noise folder, you can use it across different project, as long as the cube size of the noise volumes and that of training sub-tomograms are the same. Usually 1000 noise volumes are sufficient for the denoising. If the noise volumes are too few, the network might suffer from the overfitting. To append the new noise volumes to the already existing noise folder, you can specify the ‘start’ parameter when generate more noise volume. \n",
