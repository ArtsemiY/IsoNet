    "This step applies the already trained network to the tomogram in order to correct the missing wedge of that tomogram. The trained network can either be the network downloaded from the pretrained network in xxpath or the trained network using the user’s data. To fit the tomogram into the GPU memory, the entire tomogram is divided into multiple tiles for the missing wedge correction. The xx should be larger than xx in the prediction. This is the Overlap Tile Strategy to prevent the artifact during the montaging the tiles.  "
