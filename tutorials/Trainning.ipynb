    "### General Parameters\n",
    "#### --input_dir\n",
    "Directory of tomograms from which subtomos are sampled; Those tomograms are suggested to have similar content and imaging conditions. The format of the tomograms\\ have to be .mrc or .rec. \n",
    "#### --datas_are_subtomos, --subtomo_dir\n",
    "When your inputs are subtomograms, you should set the *datas_are_subtomos* to **True** and the *subtomo_dir* to the path of your subtomograms folder. The training dataset will be generated from provided subtomograms instead of sampling from entire tomograms.\n",
    "#### --iterations \n",
    "One iteration contains 3 steps: data preprocessing, network training, predicting. When *iteration* >1, the program will train the network iteratively. The model will be refined in current iteration based on previous prediction results. However, it doesn't mean that the more ierations the better. In practice, 50 is sufficient.\n",
    "#### --pretrained_model\n",
    "The path of the pretrained neural network model. MWR will initialize model parameters from the pretrained parameters if a pretrained neural network model with the same configuration is provided here. This model can be generated from your previous training or download.\n",
    "#### --noise_folder\n",
    "Add noise during training, Set None to disable noise reduction. \n",
    "#### --mask\n",
    "The path to your mask file. Usually, you should use mask when your tomograms contain large empty area. To avoid sampling large amount of empty sub-volumes, a mask which exclude the empty area is needed. User could either use the *mwr_cli.py make_mask* to generate the mask or get it from other programs as long as the volume dimension is consistent with your tomograms.\n",
    "#### --continue_training, --continue_iter\n",
    "Continus previous training? Every model after an iteration will be saved.When *continue_training* is set True, iterative training will start from the previously trained model of *continue_iter* \n",
    "#### --cube_size , --crop_size\n",
    "sub-tomograms with size cube_size^3 are extracted randomly from the input tomograms during data preprocessing. If masks are applied, the center of the sub-tomograms should be within the masked areas. Those sub-tomograms are then rotated and cropped to the size serve as the inp.Sub-tomograms are applied with missing wedge mask, then cropped to the crop_size size to serve as the output of the network. Usually the crop_size is 1.5 time large as the cube_size. By default, each sub-tomograms are rotated 16 times making 16 data pairs. Those generated input-output data pairs store in the data folder and will be used in the following training. \n",
