    "In preprocessing, the sub-tomograms with size **cube_size** are extracted randomly from the tomograms. If masks are applied, the center of the sub-tomograms should be within the masked areas. Those sub-tomograms are then rotated and cropped to the size serve as the input. Those same sub-tomograms are rotated, added missing wedge and then cropped to the same size to serve as the output of the network. Usually the **crop_size** is 1.5 time larger than the **cube_size**. By default, each sub-tomograms are rotated 16 times making 16 data pairs. Those generated input-output data pairs store in the **data** folder and will be used in the following training. The preprocessing step can only be performed with cpu, which specified in the parameter **preprocessing_ncpus**.\n",

Each epoch will traverse through the data set. The data pairs are grouped into batches to feed into each epoch. It is recommended that the **batchsize** times the **step_per_epoch** approximately equals the number of the data pairs. If you are using multiple GPUs, the **batchsize** should be divisible to the number of GPU. The trained neural networks are saved in the **result_dir** folder named model_iterxx.h5. \n",
